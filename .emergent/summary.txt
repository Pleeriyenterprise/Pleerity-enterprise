<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a comprehensive SaaS web application called Compliance Vault Pro for UK landlords and letting agents. The project has evolved through multiple phases, adding features like AI document scanning, bulk uploads, advanced reporting, and a multi-step client intake wizard.

Most recently, the user's priorities were:
1.  **Fix Admin Authentication (BLOCKER):** Decouple admin login from client records to ensure admins can log in independently. This is now complete and considered locked.
2.  **Implement Admin Invite Flow:** Allow existing admins to invite new admins via email. The backend for this is complete.
3.  **Comprehensive E2E Testing:** Run a full suite of tests before deployment. This has been completed successfully.

The current active request from the user is to:
1.  **Build the Admin Management UI:** A frontend page for the completed admin invite/management API.
2.  **Implement Full Address Autocomplete:** Enhance the intake wizard with street-level address suggestions.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS are detailed in .
